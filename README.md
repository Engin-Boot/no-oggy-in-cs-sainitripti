## Intention

'oggy' is mischievous and plans tricks on cockroaches.
Thus, this program intends to remove it from a list of strings.

## Method

Go to 'no_ogg.cs' file.
Go to 'RemoveOggy' method and update it as follows:
  Remove the call to 'Remove' method on names inside the for loop.
  We should not update the list while iterating over it.
  Add a 'RemoveAll' method on names.
  The method takes a predicate.
  Add condition in predicate to check if the current name starts with 'oggy' or not.
