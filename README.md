# Collections Exercise

## Intention

'oggy' is mischievous and plans tricks on cockroaches.
Thus, this program intends to remove it from a list of strings.

## Method

Go to no_ogg.cs file.

Go to RemoveOggy method and update it as follows:

  Remove the call to Remove method on names inside the for loop.
  We should not update the list while iterating over it.
  
  Add a RemoveAll method on names. 
  The method takes a predicate. 
  Add condition in predicate to check if the current name starts with 'oggy' or not.
